# findIphoneMockup
Find iPhone Mockup Project for CIS 376

In this project, I'm using jQuery, HTML, and CSS to re-create the Find My iPhone functionality. In order to create a more pleasant UX, I created an alert message whenever a user has typed in a password incorrectly or has successfully logged in.  That way, a user could type in his/her password without having to exit out of any annoying pop-ups.   The sign in button only becomes active after a user has entered his/her password.
